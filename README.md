# Algorithm Visualizer in PHP

This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) implementation in PHP, designed to visualize various algorithms, including sorting and searching. It provides an interactive platform to understand the inner workings of these algorithms.

## Features

### Sorting Algorithms

- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Counting Sort
- Bogo Sort

### Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Ternary Search
- Jump Search
- Interpolation Search
- Exponential Search
- Fibonacci Search

### Visualization with Meaningful Data

- Visualize sorting and searching algorithms with a dataset of 100 entries.
- Run the PHP scripts to dynamically generate and display meaningful information during each execution.

### Custom Data Entry

- Add your own data for sorting and searching (hard limit of 100 data entries).
- Experience the algorithms in action with personalized datasets.
